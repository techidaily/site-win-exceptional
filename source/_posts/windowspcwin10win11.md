## About Norton Ghost

Norton Ghost is one **disk imaging and cloning tool** that firstly developed in the 1990s. It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can [restore your computer to previous functional status](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/). Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.

In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is **no longer available for the Home user**. It was **discontinued by Symantec in 2013**. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.

## How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step

Here in this guide, you will get the detailed steps about how to use Symantec Ghost in Windows 11/10/8/7\. You can simply search “**Norton Ghost 15 download**” via your browser to get the tool. As we have mentioned above, it only offers a 30-day free trial. If you prefer a free tool to help you backup, restore or clone your hard drive, you can refer to the [next part](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) to get the best free alternative to Norton Ghost.

### Image Your Computer with Norton Ghost

1\. Install Norton Ghost and open it. It will run a step-by-step wizard the first time you open it. At last, you will see the **Easy Setup** interface where you can create a backup at once. You can also click the **Cancel** option and set the backup task later.

2\. On the Home screen, you can create a backup task by clicking **Define Backup Wizard** or **Run or Manage Backups**. Here we choose the latter one.

[![Create Backup](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/create-backup.png)

[![Click Custom](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/click-custom.png)

4\. Finally, click **OK** to confirm.

### Restore Image with Norton Ghost

Click **Recover My Files** if you want to recover files or folder, or **Recover My Computer** to make it.

**Recover My Files:**

1\. On **Recover My Files** screen, you can find the files you want to restore through **File and Folder** & **Recovery Point**.

2\. Whichever you choose, you can type the file name you need in the box under **Find files to recover** and click **Search** to find it.

[![Recover My Files](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/find-files-to-recover.png)

2\. On the **Tools** page, click **Copy My Hard Drive** and follow the steps in the wizard to copy the drive.
